Okay, this gives me a much clearer picture of your project's scope and goals. It's exciting, a modular backend for LLM interactions with a focus on code understanding and utility features! I can definitely help you strategize and build this.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, focusing on a modular design:

**1. Core Modules & Functionality**

Based on your description, here are some core modules you might consider:

*   **`llm_module` (LLM Interaction):**
    *   **Purpose:** Handles communication with the chosen LLM (e.g., Google Gemini via `google-genai`).
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `send_prompt(prompt: str) -> str`: Sends a prompt to the LLM and returns the response.
        *   `send_code_prompt(code: str, context: str) -> str`: Sends code along with a context prompt to the LLM.
        *   `chat_session(messages: list) -> str`: Handles multiple turns of conversation with the LLM.
        *   `translate_instruction_to_code_prompt(instruction: str) -> str`: Takes user intent (like, explain this code) and translates it into a LLM prompt.
    *   **Abstraction:** This module should abstract away the specifics of the LLM API (Google Gemini in this case). This allows you to easily switch to a different LLM later.

*   **`file_module` (File Handling):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages interaction with files on the local system.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `read_file(path: str) -> str`: Reads the content of a file.
        *   `read_directory(path: str) -> list[str]`: List all files in a directory.
        *   `choose_file(files: list[str], prompt: str) -> str`: Lets the user choose a file from a list with a prompt.
        *   `create_file(path: str, content: str)`: Create a new file with content
        *   `search_code(path: str, term: str) -> list[str]`: Search all code in path for terms and returns matched code sections
*   **`code_analysis_module` (Code Processing and Context):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides functionality to parse, analyze, and understand code.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `extract_code_context(code: str) -> str`: Extracts relevant context from a code file (e.g., language, key functions).
        *   `summarize_code(code: str) -> str`: Summarizes the code, helping the LLM to better process complex files.
        *   `code_with_prompt(code: str, predefined_prompt: str) -> str`: Feeds code with predefined prompt
*   **`integration_module` (External Services):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages integrations with external services like GitHub, Notion, and Jira.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `create_github_file(path: str, content: str) -> str`: Creates a file in a GitHub repository (authentication would be required).
        *   `create_notion_page(page_content: str) -> str`: Creates a page in a Notion workspace (authentication required).
        *   `create_jira_issue(issue_summary: str, issue_description: str) -> str`: Creates a Jira issue (authentication required).
        *   `parse_link(text: str) -> str`: parses link from text (for example notion link)

*   **`config_module` (Configuration):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages configuration settings for the application.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `load_config(file_path: str) -> dict`: Load configuration from a file
        *   `save_config(config: dict, file_path: str) -> None` save the config.
        *   `read_enviroment_var(var: str) -> str`: reads specific eniroment vars

**2. Modularity Principles**

*   **Clear Interfaces:** Each module should have a well-defined set of functions (API) that other modules can use.
*   **Low Coupling:** Modules should not depend too heavily on the internal workings of other modules. Use the interfaces only.
*   **High Cohesion:** Each module should focus on a specific set of related tasks.
*   **Testability:** Modules should be designed so they can be tested independently.
*   **Extensibility:** Make it easy to add new modules or modify existing ones.

**3. How I Can Help You**

Here's how I can contribute to your project:

*   **Code Generation:** I can generate the Python code for the modules described above. I can create the basic structure, function definitions, and even some of the implementation details.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** I can help you craft effective prompts for the LLM that will elicit the information you need. This includes prompts for code explanation, code context extraction, and utility tasks.
*   **Error Handling:** I can help you implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Design Guidance:** I can discuss design patterns, architectural choices, and other aspects of software development to make your project more maintainable and scalable.
*   **Testing:** I can help you write unit tests for each module.
*   **Suggesting Third party Libs:** Can suggest third party libs for your project like parsing and code analysis.
*   **API Documentation:** I can assist with documenting your modules APIs.

**4. Starting Point**

Let's start with the `llm_module`. What parameters and functions would you like it to have?  Then we can generate code for you.
I can help you design, implement and write tests.
