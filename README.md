Okay, this gives me a much clearer picture of your project's scope and goals. It's exciting, a modular backend for LLM interactions with a focus on code understanding and utility features! I can definitely help you strategize and build this.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, focusing on a modular design:

**1. Core Modules & Functionality**

Based on your description, here are some core modules you might consider:

*   **`llm_module` (LLM Interaction):**
    *   **Purpose:** Handles communication with the chosen LLM (e.g., Google Gemini via `google-genai`).
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `send_prompt(prompt: str) -> str`: Sends a prompt to the LLM and returns the response.
        *   `send_code_prompt(code: str, context: str) -> str`: Sends code along with a context prompt to the LLM.
        *   `chat_session(messages: list) -> str`: Handles multiple turns of conversation with the LLM.
        *   `translate_instruction_to_code_prompt(instruction: str) -> str`: Takes user intent (like, explain this code) and translates it into a LLM prompt.
    *   **Abstraction:** This module should abstract away the specifics of the LLM API (Google Gemini in this case). This allows you to easily switch to a different LLM later.

*   **`file_module` (File Handling):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages interaction with files on the local system.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `read_file(path: str) -> str`: Reads the content of a file.
        *   `read_directory(path: str) -> list[str]`: List all files in a directory.
        *   `choose_file(files: list[str], prompt: str) -> str`: Lets the user choose a file from a list with a prompt.
        *   `create_file(path: str, content: str)`: Create a new file with content
        *   `search_code(path: str, term: str) -> list[str]`: Search all code in path for terms and returns matched code sections
*   **`code_analysis_module` (Code Processing and Context):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides functionality to parse, analyze, and understand code.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `extract_code_context(code: str) -> str`: Extracts relevant context from a code file (e.g., language, key functions).
        *   `summarize_code(code: str) -> str`: Summarizes the code, helping the LLM to better process complex files.
        *   `code_with_prompt(code: str, predefined_prompt: str) -> str`: Feeds code with predefined prompt
*   **`integration_module` (External Services):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages integrations with external services like GitHub, Notion, and Jira.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `create_github_file(path: str, content: str) -> str`: Creates a file in a GitHub repository (authentication would be required).
        *   `create_notion_page(page_content: str) -> str`: Creates a page in a Notion workspace (authentication required).
        *   `create_jira_issue(issue_summary: str, issue_description: str) -> str`: Creates a Jira issue (authentication required).
        *   `parse_link(text: str) -> str`: parses link from text (for example notion link)

*   **`config_module` (Configuration):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages configuration settings for the application.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `load_config(file_path: str) -> dict`: Load configuration from a file
        *   `save_config(config: dict, file_path: str) -> None` save the config.
        *   `read_enviroment_var(var: str) -> str`: reads specific eniroment vars

**2. Modularity Principles**

*   **Clear Interfaces:** Each module should have a well-defined set of functions (API) that other modules can use.
*   **Low Coupling:** Modules should not depend too heavily on the internal workings of other modules. Use the interfaces only.
*   **High Cohesion:** Each module should focus on a specific set of related tasks.
*   **Testability:** Modules should be designed so they can be tested independently.
*   **Extensibility:** Make it easy to add new modules or modify existing ones.

    *   **Data Validation (Schemas):** Uses Pydantic to validate data input and output.
    *   **Database:** Abstract database interactions from your core logic.
*   **Modularity:** Group related functions into modules (as we already discussed).
*   **Configuration Management:**  Load your settings and secrets through a dedicated configuration system.
*   **Pydantic Validation:** Use Pydantic schemas to validate data types and structures both for your API requests and responses
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** If you have potentially long-running operations, make use of FastAPI's asynchronous support `async def`.
*   **Testing:**  Write tests for each module and component.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Use FastAPI's built-in dependency injection capabilities to manage dependencies between components.
*   **API Versioning:** Consider versioning your API endpoints if you expect them to change over time.
*   **Logging:** Use Python's logging module for monitoring and debugging.

**Benefits of this structure:**

*   **Improved Organization:** Easier to navigate, understand and manage your code.
*   **Increased Modularity:** Code is separated into smaller, reusable modules.
*   **Better Testability:** You can test individual components and modules in isolation.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to make changes and updates to the code.
*   **Scalability:** Allows your project to grow with the addition of new features and functionalities.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Create this directory structure in your `backend` folder.
2.  Start implementing the `main.py` file with the basic FastAPI setup.
3.  Begin adding routes inside the `api` module.
4.  Move the corresponding logic into the `core` folder.
5.  Start using `pydantic` for validation and creating schemas in the `schemas` dir.
6.  Then you can add a configuration loader and database integration.

I can help you with the code for these steps. Let me know where you'd like to start, or if you have questions.


***

Okay, let's dive deeper into why this specific directory structure is considered a best practice for FastAPI applications, and how it aligns with principles of good software design:

**1. Clarity and Organization**

*   **`backend/` as a Root:** It clearly separates the backend from the frontend (if you have one) and keeps your project well-defined.
*   **`app/` for Core Application:** This distinguishes the core application logic from other concerns, making it clear where your FastAPI app resides.
*   **`api/` for API Routes:** This folder clearly indicates where API endpoints are defined, making it easy to find and manage them. Separating API definitions from business logic helps maintain a clean separation of concerns.
*   **`core/` for Business Logic:** This is a crucial separation. It keeps your core logic independent from how the data comes in (API requests) or how it's sent out (API responses). This promotes reuse, testability, and easier maintenance.
*   **`config/` for Configuration:** Managing configuration separately is vital. It allows you to easily change settings based on the environment (development, testing, production) without modifying the application code. It also makes it easier to manage environment variables.
*   **`database/` for Database Interactions:** Keeping database models and setup separate from your business logic allows you to switch databases more easily. It also helps to keep data-access code organized, and more easily testable.
*   **`schemas/` for Data Validation:** This is where Pydantic models are placed. Keeping these in their own space helps separate the data structures and rules from other aspects of the code, making them more modular and reusable. It promotes clear separation between the data structures and the processing logic that uses them.
*   **`utils/` for Shared Utilities:** Utilities are functions that serve a common purpose throughout your project, so having this dir avoid duplications.
*   **`tests/` for Test Code:** Having a dedicated tests directory keeps test code separate from the application code. It allows for easily test your API and its business logic.

**2. Separation of Concerns (SoC)**

This structure heavily emphasizes the principle of "separation of concerns." This means each part of the application has a distinct purpose and is responsible for a specific set of tasks. Why is this important?

*   **Maintainability:** When concerns are separated, it's much easier to modify one part of the code without affecting other parts. Changes are isolated.
*   **Testability:** Testing is much simpler when each component has a specific job. You can write unit tests to ensure individual functions and classes behave correctly.
*   **Reusability:** Components can often be reused in different parts of the application.
*   **Clarity:** Developers can easily find the code they are looking for without searching through large files containing unrelated functionality.
*   **Readability:** Code becomes easier to understand since it's organized by role.

**3. Modularity**

*   **Independent Modules:** The structure promotes the creation of independent modules (e.g., `llm.py`, `file.py`, `integration.py`). Each module has a focused responsibility.
*   **Easier Extension:** Adding new functionality is straightforward. You can create new modules or expand on existing ones without impacting other parts of the codebase.
*   **Code Reuse:** Modular code is more likely to be reused in different areas of the application or even in other projects.

**4. Scalability**

*   **Growing Complexity:** As your application grows, the structure helps to manage the complexity. You can add more modules or files without making it overwhelming.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously without worrying too much about the inner workings of other parts of the code.
*   **Microservices Potential:** If you intend to convert your app into a microservices architecture in the future, this structure will be very helpful.

**5. FastAPI Specific Benefits**

*   **FastAPI's Dependency Injection:** This directory structure complements FastAPI's dependency injection. You can inject instances of your `core/` classes into your API routes.
*   **Pydantic for Validation:** The `schemas/` directory reinforces the use of Pydantic for data validation, which aligns perfectly with FastAPI's design philosophy.
*   **Clear API Definition:** The `api/` directory provides a clear and organized view of your API endpoints.

**Analogy**

Think of this directory structure like a well-organized kitchen:

*   **`backend/`:** The entire kitchen.
*   **`app/`:** The main cooking area.
*   **`api/`:** The serving station where you prepare and present the food.
*   **`core/`:** The food storage and prep area with all your ingredients and utensils.
*   **`config/`:** The kitchen's instruction book that tells you how to use the appliances and ingredients.
*   **`database/`:** The pantry where all your preserved goods are stored.
*   **`schemas/`:** The recipe cards that describe the format of each dish.
*   **`utils/`:** The kitchen tools that are used for multiple purposes.
*   **`tests/`:** The quality control team.

Each part of the kitchen has a specific function, and this organization makes it much more efficient and easier to use. Similarly, the directory structure promotes a clear separation of duties and a more maintainable codebase.

In summary, this structure is not just a list of folders; it's a strategic way of organizing code that aligns with best practices for creating robust, maintainable, and scalable web applications using FastAPI.


***

Okay, I understand. You're looking for a more robust, highly modular, and extensible backend structure that can serve as a solid foundation for all your future projects, going beyond standard FastAPI conventions. You want something more akin to a SaaS boilerplate, focusing on long-term maintainability and scalability.

Let's iterate on the previous structure, keeping these enhancements in mind:

**Key Enhancements and Reasoning:**

1.  **Feature-Based Modules (`app/modules/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:** Replaces the generic `core` directory with feature-based modules. Each module (e.g., `auth`, `code`, `llm`, `file`, `integration`, `users`) encapsulates all logic, models, and utilities related to a specific feature of the application.
    *   **Benefit:** Significantly enhances modularity, making it clear where specific functionalities reside. New features are easily added by creating new modules. Each module can have its own configuration, models, tests, etc.
    *   **Structure within Modules:** Each module can have:
        *   `core.py` or `services.py`: Business logic.
        *   `models.py`: Database models specific to that module.
        *   `utils.py`: Utility functions for that module.
        *   `config.py`: Configuration settings for that module.

2.  **API Versioning (`app/api/v1/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:**  Includes API versioning.
    *   **Benefit:** Makes the API more flexible and easy to manage by providing backwards compatibility and easier upgrades.

3.  **Global Core (`app/core/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:**  The `core` directory is now reserved for global-level components, such as:
        *   `database.py`: Handles database setup and connections.
        *   `config.py`: Manages global configuration loading.
        *   `security.py`: Common security utilities.
    *   **Benefit:** Keeps global concerns separate from module-specific logic.

4.  **Authentication Module (`app/modules/auth/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:** Handles authentication and authorization logic.
    *   **Benefit:** Centralizes and separates authentication, allowing for flexibility in authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

5.  **Custom Middleware (`app/middleware/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:** To handle authentication and authorization and other cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging and request parsing.
    *   **Benefit:** To add auth middleware, making the whole process more reusable and easier to maintain.

6.  **Dedicated Testing (`tests/modules/`)**:
    *   **Purpose:** Test each feature and module functionality.
    *   **Benefit:** Easier and more comprehensive test coverage for your modules.

7. **`docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Allows you to define a multi container application to use with docker.
    *   **Benefit:** Easier for you and your team to start with preconfigured environment for you app.

8.  **Enhanced `utils/`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This folder contain project common utils for example common loggin functionality, error handling or something else that can be used in the whole project.
    *   **Benefit**: Avoid code duplications and maintain a unified code style.

**Benefits of This Iteration:**

*   **Enhanced Modularity:** Feature-based modules make the application highly modular and easy to extend.
*   **Clearer Structure:** Clear separation between API, modules, core logic, configuration, and tests.
*   **More Reusable Code:** Modules encapsulate functionality that can be reused in other projects.
*   **Scalability:** This structure is designed to scale well with increasing complexity.
*   **Better Maintainability:** Makes it easier to find, modify, and test different parts of the code.
*   **SaaS-Ready:** Provides a robust foundation for a multi-feature SaaS application.
*   **Team-Friendly:** Makes collaboration more efficient with clearly defined boundaries.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Refactor**: If you have already created the previous project structure, refactor your code to follow this updated structure.
2.  **Start with Authentication**: Implement the authentication module with models, services, and JWT.
3.  **Then Add a new Feature**:  Implement a feature module like `code` and include corresponding api, logic, models and tests.
4.  **Repeat**: Continue implementing and iterating module by module.

This structure is designed to be a solid, long-term solution for your projects. Let me know if you have specific questions or need help with code implementations.
